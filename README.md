# RPVM
Raspberry Pi VM implementation in C++ (can run in any computer that can run c files)

# Info
This is a vm that i will be developing for quite a while that is made using the Raspberry Pi mofel B+.  The aim of this program it to make it easy to develope programs in assembly language  that solve problems alike a traditional vm would. NOTE : this vm is not is anyway like any specific computer architecture.
 
I will be developing a new language called **Scorpion. The high level part i will develope last because that is the hardest portion in this vm. Wtriting programs in the vm will operate at a low level allowing the simulation of programming a computer. 

# Specifications
The vm will have an organized process for executing code. Below is a simple representation of the process of writing programs in scorpion.

              [source] ========> High level source code 'helloworld.sc'
                 ||
              [source] =========> Low level assembly source code 'helloworld.sasm'
                 ||
           [machine code] =======> Direct 'machine' code for the vm to execute 'hello.bo'
                 ||
                [VM] =============> The virtural machiene can now run the object code
                 ||
              (output)
           
Th first part in the process is high level source code written in Scorpion. The file extention must end with .sc in order for the assembler to build a 'sasm' file. The source code in scorpion is alot alike c and java combined with some additional advantages. A 'sasm' file(scorpion assmebly) file is then generated by the language compiler. The sasm file is one step closer to machiene instructions that the vm can directly execute. The next stage is the generation of the machiene code instructions for the vm. The generated file will be a '.bo'(binary object) file that holds only 1's, 0's, and .'s. Once this file is generated you can then run the vm with the .bo file. All programs will be written and build in c++.

# Programs
Based on the specifications defined, for everthing to work there are a total of 3 programs needed to run the vm.

The first program is 'scpnc'(scorpion compiler) which is used to compile the high level source code down to assembly language. The next program is 'sasm'(scorpion assembler) which will translate the assembly code to binary object format. Finally the last program is the vm itself called 'svm' which runs the bo files.

# Notes
I will program all these programs from the bottom up. i.e. first the vm, next the assembler, and finally the high level language compiler.
