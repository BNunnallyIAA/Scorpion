{"name":"Scorpion","tagline":"A bare metal new programming language implemented in C++","body":"### Welcome to Scorpion.\r\nScorpion is a dynamic bare metal programming language supporting various programming paradigms. It provides a set of features that allow for easy text and data processing as well as programming the physical hardware on a specific device. It is very simple and easy to use. Scorpion is intended to be used for embedded systems and consumer applications that runs on micro-electronics. Check out the repo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_root_dir/Github\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/AndroDevcd/Scorpion/\r\n$ cd Scorpion/\r\n$ sudo cp \"bin/linux_debian/raspberryPi/0.0.19_19 beta\" /bin\r\n$ sudo scorpion -help\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Why Scorpion?\r\nScorpion was designed to simplify low level assembly language programming. It provides a lot of the features you would get in a low level assembly language while still supporting some essential high level features as well. Scorpion has a wide range of benefits such as:\r\n-  A very Simple Syntax.\r\n-  Easy to learn. Scorpion was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than many other traditional assembly languages.\r\n-  Fast execution time of programs(1.5Mhz processor speed).\r\n-  Support for low level programming of physical computer hardware.\r\n-  Somewhat object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.\r\n-  Scorpion is platform-independent.\r\n-  Open source under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2015 (@AndroDevcd) founded the Scorpion programming language and has been developing the language since then. (@adamlglover) also helped with the documentation of the language as well.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Scorpion?
