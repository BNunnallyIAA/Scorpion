##Simple-Os
Simple-Os is a very tiny compact Os with a few features that will run on top of the Scorpion VM. I will be developing this Os for 
a while as I develope the Scorpion Virtural machine more.

######Features
-    Simple console interface(with a few coommands)
-    a compact digital filesystem(may use real filesystem later)
-    simple system back-end framework(the Os its self including BIOS and kernal)
