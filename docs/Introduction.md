# Introduction
Scorpion is a dynamic bare metal programming language supporting various programming paradigms. 
It provides a set of features that allow for easy text and data processing as well as programming the 
physical hardware on a specific device. If you like programming a computer from a low level where you 
have full control over memory management and data manipulation, Scorpion is the language for you. It is 
designed to be simple enough that you can achieve fluency in the language. Its commands and syntax 
resembles that of an assembly programming language(not of any specific processor) but is organized differently 
with extended capabilities and features that make this language simpler than a traditional assembly language.

The Scorpion programming language contains a miniature internal system (The Scorpion Virtual Machine) that handles 
all information and data processing. This system allows for Scorpion source code to be portable considering that 
this system does not change across devices. Unfortunately however, this system tremendously slows down the execution 
time of running programs in scorpion.

Scorpion allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Scorpion programs. It comes with a 
large collection of standard modules and built-in functions that you can use as the basis of your programs â€” or as 
examples to start learning to program in Scorpion. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, 
text processing, and exception and interrupt management.

Scorpion source code does not have to be written in any particular editor or IDE - which is great for quick throw away programs.

This general guide is a quick guide to get you started with Scorpion programming and is not an in-depth explanation on how to 
program in Scorpion.

## 1.1 Invoking The interpreter
If you have yet to set up Scorpion, see: "Setting Things Up". Once Scorpion is set up correctly it will be set in your path on your 
machine and can be directly typed in as a command. The Scorpion Virtual Machine takes 2 types of arguments when invoking the interpreter.

                Arg 1:
                $  scorpion [option]
                Arg 2:
                $  scorpion [program] [args...]

The first argument simply passes an option to the VM, prints out the result, and exits the program. An option may consist of "-help", 
"-version", and more. Each option will perform something different for telling the Scorpion VM to perform an action. The second argument 
that is passed to the VM is an example of running a program in Scorpion. When running a program in Scorpion, you can pass arguments 
to your program to be used as arguments for your program. For example, you may be developing a file-reader program that prints out what 
is in the files that you passed to the VM. Your program must be in binary format, meaning that the file must only contain 1's, 0's, .'s, and whitespace, while having the .b extension. If the file violates any of these rules, the VM will throw an error stating for you to check the log to find out what went wrong. When passing your program to the VM, you do not need to include the .b extension to the end of your program. In fact, if you do, the VM will throw an error stating it could not load the program. Below is an example of this.

              $  scorpion file_reader /data/data.txt grocery_list.txt HelloWorld.cpp
              
The above example program "file_reader" takes files as arguments and prints the contents of what is in those files.              

## 1.2 A simple explanation
The Scorpion Virtual machine in laymen's terms is a fictional machine that resides in your computer's memory and emulates the components 
that are on that device. The end user will have a very similar experience on the Scorpion VM as they would have on the dedicated hardware.
Scorpion is an extremely low level language and provides access to all the hardware on a specific machine ready to be programmed.

#### 1.2.1 Memory
Depending on the machine the Scorpion VM is running on will determine the amount of memory that it can access. Instead of having "heap memory" 
or a pool of memory addresses that holds all variables and data, the Scorpion VM provides a virtualized ram chip that emulates the physical chip 
that is on your device. 

If you are more interested in learning about this virtual ram chip, see: "Advanced Memory Concepts" to learn more.

#### 1.2.2 The Digital processor
The Scorpion Virtual Machine provides a Digital processor or virtual cpu that works as the heart of the SRE (Scorpion Runtime Environment). This virtual cpu is what you will be programming to do everything from performing simple math to processing a txt file. This digital processor emulates how a real microprocessor would operate and gives the end user a similar experience as the dedicated hardware would provide. When programming in Scorpion, you will be learning this "digital processor" and how it works to use it's capabilities to your advantage to program it to do just about anything you would want it to do.
